Description: A suite of utility functions for working with environmental time
    series data from known locations. The compact data model is structured as a 
    list with two dataframes. A 'meta' dataframe contains spatial metadata
    associated with known locations. A 'data' dataframe contains a 'datetime'
    column followed by measurements made at each time.
