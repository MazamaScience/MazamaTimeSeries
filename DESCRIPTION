Description: Utility functions for working with environmental time series data from known 
    locations. The compact data model is structured as a list with two dataframes. A 
    'meta' dataframe contains spatial and measuring device metadata associated with 
    deployments at known locations. A 'data' dataframe contains a 'datetime' column 
    followed by columns of measurements associated with each "device-deployment".
